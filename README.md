# Casks

This repository only serves to give HomeBrew-Cask support for games of mine.

A few important notes:

- When posting issues in the issue tracker please only report issues regarding these casks. Don't report issues in the games themselves as they will all be closed and ignored. Go to the respective issue tracker of the game/utility in question. If there is none, then go to [https://github.com/PhantasarProductions/Old-Games/issues](The Old Games Issue tracker) in stead).
- Games still in beta will not be posted here, only finished projects.
- Some projects already finished and stable may not yet appear here, but they will be soon. If you really want me to hurry a project up,then post it in the issue tracker of this repository, or in the issue tracker of the game in question (it is has an repository).
